## Robinson Center Saturday Enrichment Program

## Winter 2016 Astronomy Course: Alien Worlds

**Instructor:** Kristen Garofali

Here you will find information (syllabus, assignments and lectures) for
the Robinson Center Saturday course I am currently teaching. This quarter
the course is entitled "Alien Worlds," and focuses on exoplanets, or planets
outside the solar system. Students will address
the following questions throughout the course of the quarter:

- How do we detect and characterize exoplanets?
- What factors determine if an exoplanet is likely to be habitable?
- How is habitability of alien worlds portrayed in popular shows and movies versus
how do scientists view habitable exoplanets?
- How common are habitable exoplanets and what does this mean for our search for
intelligent life on other worlds?
